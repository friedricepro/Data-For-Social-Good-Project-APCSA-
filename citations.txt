In our program, the only sources we used were:
1. Mr. Aiello
2. chatGPT

Let me explain. Our program is about writing the information about your sick pet(type,gender,symptoms) and our program will predict what disease or sickness your pet may have.
I managed to integrate kaggle data and inputs but there was one issue I encountered. I did not know how to find the specific disease based on the users provided information. I first asked
Mr Aiello for help, he gave me a sample version but with diets. I analyzed it and wrote my own version for my program 

At first this was my initial code:

if(t == animalTypeInput && g == genderInput && s == symptomInput){
    return ("Using that information, we believe that your pet may have: " + diseases[i]);
}

It did not work and at first I did not understand why, but I then asked chatgpt.

Here is what chatgpt gave me:

if(t.equals(animalTypeInput.toLowerCase()) && g.equals(genderInput.toLowerCase()) && s.equals(symptomInput.toLowerCase())){
    return "Using that information, we believe that your pet may have: " + diseases[i];
}

I learned that I had to use the java .equals() method because == only checks if they are the same object. And if I use the .toLowerCase(), it will help me compare strings easier.
My idea was correct but my execution was wrong. 

11/18/25 Used ChatGPT to find unique values in animal_type, symptom, diseases, and symptom2 txt files to save time and use in DataRunner

11/19/25 Used ChatGPT to final check the code for logic errors and potentially wrong outcomes
Told me that everything was up to standards but need to be more specific for the multiline comment regarding the findDisease method
